## Assignment Overview
## Feature 
- **Three-Word Address Input:** Users can input any three-word address, which is then used to find the antipodal location on the globe.
  
- **Antipodal Point Calculation:** The app accurately calculates the antipodal coordinates and converts them back into a three-word address.

- **Formatted Display:** The antipodal three-word address is displayed with leading slashes (e.g., `///filled.count.soap`), and the slashes are highlighted in a distinct color (red) for better visual clarity.

- **Persistent History:** Each lookup is stored in a history list that persists across app sessions. This allows users to easily access previously searched addresses even after the app is restarted.

- **Tab-Based Navigation:** The app offers a smooth navigation experience with tabs to switch between the search functionality and the history view.
